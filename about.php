					<p>An ivy stone or Ivy Day stone is a class memorial stone unveiled at annual Ivy Day celebrations at several Ivy League American universities.  They are often placed on the sides of academic buildings. Since 1873 at the University of Pennsylvania, students have presented class ivy stones at the annual Ivy Day before commencement.</p>
					<br>
					<p>IvyStones.com is a scavenger hunt to find the many Ivy Day stones hidden around the University of Pennsylvania campus.  Players can create an account and keep track of the stones that they've found as well as compare their finds with other players.</p>
